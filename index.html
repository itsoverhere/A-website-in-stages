                    How good do you think your memory is? How about your reflexes? Put it to the test in the game inspired by the classic Simon from our childhood game comes the application Copy Simon: The Ultimate Memory Game.

                    Copy Simon is a simple yet addictive memory game. The game itself consists of 4 buttons in the middle which by default are green, yellow, red and, blue arranged in a 2 x 2 format. When the game starts, the buttons would light up in a random order and play sounds that vary per button. The player then would have to repeat the same sequence depending on the color and order that it lit up. When the player inputs the wrong sequence then it’s GAME OVER. If the user’s score is high enough then it prompts the user to input his name to be saved in the top 10 local high scores list on its respective game mode.
